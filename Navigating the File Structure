From this website we can download the Crucial MX200 MU05 Update.

We can then go to where we downloaded this .zip file and unzip it using the command: $ unzip MX200_MU05_Update.zip

This gives us a .iso file. We can decompress this file using 7zip and the command: $ 7z x MX200_MU05_Update.iso

This gives us four directories. The scratch, cde, and '[BOOT]' directories aren't very important but are somewhat interesting. What we are focused on is the boot/ directory.

If we go into the boot directory we see that we have a file called core.gz. This is the core of our firmware that has been compressed with gunzip.
