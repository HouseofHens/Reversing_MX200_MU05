# ReversingMX200

This is the Main Repository created by Sim Bowden, Dawson Eldred, and Brendan Henry for our Capstone Project in the 2021 Academic Year in the Cyber Operations Major

- ## Understanding Files:  
  - ### Potential Attacks:  
    - Potential Attacks is a text file that describes attacks that we believe could take place on a firmware file such as the one located within this repository. We do not have actual built attacks but instead describe what we believe could take place.

  - ### Firmware:
    - Firmware is a snippit of the file structure that is located within the MX200 MU05 Update File. Within there is the actual firmware that is labeled 1.bin. This is the file that we are talking about when we are talking about the firmware itself.
  
  - ### firmware.sh:
    - firmware.sh is a bash file that we found within the MU05 update. This file we believe is meant to actually copy the new firmware itself onto the Solid State Drive.
  
  - ### Navigating the File Structure:
    - Navigating the File Structure is a file that we have created to outline the steps that we went through to find these files above. In it we detail the steps that we took in order to uncompress different files and illustrate where we found these important files so that the steps could be recreated.
